# Data Carpentry for Geospatial Data in Urbanism

A Data Carpentry workshop aims to teach researchers basic concepts, skills and tools for working with data, so that they can get more done in less time and with less pain.

The Data Carpentry for Geospatial Data in Urbanism is a two full days hands-on workshop (live coding and exercises), which covers:

- Introduction to R for Geospatial Data (e.g. Import data into R, calculate summary statistics, and create publication-quality graphics)  
- Introduction to Geospatial Vector and Raster Data with R (e.g. Open, work with, and plot vector and raster-format spatial data in R)  

## Prerequisites

Participants must have access to a computer with a Mac, Linux, or Windows operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) that they have administrative privileges on. They should have a few specific software packages installed (listed here). No previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented in the workshop is required.
