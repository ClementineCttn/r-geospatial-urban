If you believe someone is violating the [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html), we ask that you report it to The Carpentries Code of Conduct Committee [completing this form](https://goo.gl/forms/KoUfO53Za3apOuOK2), who will take the appropriate action to address the situation.

## Practicalities 

::: {.incremental}

- **Photos and videos will be taken** - indicate your consent to be photographed or filmed on your wearable name tag (green = YES, red = NO) or simply let us know if you prefer not to display your choice.

- **Ph.D. candidates receive 1,5 GS credits** if they attend the entire workshop - attendance forms will be handed out at the end of Day 2.

- **Lunch** (both days), **coffee/tea** (breaks) and **drinks** (end of day 2) will be provided.
