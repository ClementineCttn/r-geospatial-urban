## What will you (not) learn?

::: {.fragment}

<span style="font-size: 75%;">Quoting from the pre-workshop survey:</span>

:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

- âœ… "to use <span style="text-decoration: underline; -webkit-text-decoration-color: red; text-decoration-color: red;">Python</span> or R to process data in a more efficient way"</span>
- âœ… "R language"
- âœ… "Learning a new programming language"
- âœ… "I hope to learn skills that can make me more efficient and self-sufficient"

:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}

- âœ… "To be more efficient in collecting, managing and working with <span style="text-decoration: underline; -webkit-text-decoration-color: red; text-decoration-color: red;">large datasets</span> through the applications surrounding geodata analysis."
- âœ… "To learn how to cope with <span style="text-decoration: underline; -webkit-text-decoration-color: red; text-decoration-color: red;">large datasets</span> in a more efficient way then using exel or GIS software."

## How do we work?

::: {.incremental}

- **Code along** with the instructor.

- With **ðŸŸ© <font color="green">green</font> and ðŸŸ¥ <font color="red">red</font> sticky notes** you indicate that you ðŸŸ© <font color="green">are</font> or ðŸŸ¥ <font color="red">are not</font> on track when prompted by the instructor. 

- When you are stuck, **put a ðŸŸ¥ <font color="red">red</font> sticky note on the back of your screen** and a helper will approach you.

- **Copy & paste code from the [livecode repository](https://edu.nl/wa4xu)** if you are behind and need to catch up.

## Code of conduct

- Use welcoming and inclusive language

- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences

- Gracefully accept constructive criticism

- Focus on what is best for the community

- Show courtesy and respect towards other community members

If you believe someone is violating the [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html), we ask that you report it to The Carpentries Code of Conduct Committee [completing this form](https://goo.gl/forms/KoUfO53Za3apOuOK2), who will take the appropriate action to address the situation.

## Practicalities 

::: {.incremental}

- **The instructors and their screen will be filmed**, but you will not be video- or audio-recorded. By participating in the workshop you acknowledge that the recording is taking place and that you don't have any objection to it. We also kindly ask you to not video- and/or audio-record the session yourself.

- **Ph.D. candidates receive 1,5 GS credits** if they attend and actively participate in the entire workshop - attendance forms will be handed out at the end of Day 2.

- **Lunch** (both days), **coffee/tea** (breaks) and **drinks** (end of day 2) will be provided.
