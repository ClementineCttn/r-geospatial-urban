# Intro to raster data

## The `raster` package

## Challenge 1: **2 mins**

Use `describe()` to determine the following about the `tud-dsm-hill.tif` file:

1. Does this file have the same CRS as `DSM_TUD`?
2. What is resolution of the raster data?
3. How large would a 5x5 pixel area be on the Earth’s surface?
4. Is the file a multi- or single-band raster?

``` {r}
#| echo: false
#| cache: false
countdown::countdown(minutes = 2)
``` 

# Plotting raster data

## Challenge 2: **5 mins**

Create a plot of the TU Delft Digital Surface Model (`DSM_TUD`) that has:

1. Six classified ranges of values (break points) that are evenly divided among the range of pixel values.
2. A plot title.

``` {r}
#| echo: false
#| cache: false
countdown::countdown(minutes = 5)
``` 

# Reprojecting raster data

## Challenge 3: **2 mins**

View the CRS for each of these two datasets. What projection does each use?

``` {r}
#| echo: false
#| cache: false
countdown::countdown(minutes = 2)
``` 

# Raster calculations

## Challenge 4: **10 mins**

It’s often a good idea to explore the range of values in a raster dataset just like we might explore a dataset that we collected in the field.

1. What is the min and max value for the Canopy Height Model `CHM_TUD` that we just created?
3. What is the distribution of all the pixel values in the CHM?
5. Plot the `CHM_TUD` raster using breaks that make sense for the data. Include an appropriate color palette for the data, plot title and no axes ticks / labels.

``` {r}
#| echo: false
#| cache: false
countdown::countdown(minutes = 10)
```
