We often want to combine values of and perform calculations on rasters to create a new output raster. This episode covers how to subtract one raster from another using basic raster math.

## Raster calculations in R

Let's say we are interested in mapping the heights of trees and buildings across an urban area. To that end, we can calculate the difference between the Digital Surface Model (DSM, tops of trees and buildings) and the Digital Terrain Model (DTM, ground level). The resulting dataset is referred to as a Canopy Height Model (CHM) and represents the actual height of trees, buildings, etc. with the influence of ground elevation removed.

## Load the Data

For this episode, we will use the DTM and DSM data which we already have loaded from previous episodes.

We use the `describe()` function to view information about the DTM and DSM data files. 
```{r dtm-dsm-describe}
describe("data/tud-dtm-5m.tif")
describe("data/tud-dsm-5m.tif")
```

We have already loaded and worked with these two data files in earlier episodes. Let’s plot them each once more to remind ourselves what this data looks like. First we plot the DTM elevation data:
```{r plot-dtm}
ggplot() +
  geom_raster(
    data = DTM_TUD_df,
    aes(x = x, y = y, fill = `tud-dtm-5m`)
  ) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Elevation", colors = terrain.colors(10)) +
  coord_equal()
```

And then the DSM elevation data:
```{r plot-dsm}
ggplot() +
  geom_raster(
    data = DSM_TUD_df,
    aes(x = x, y = y, fill = `tud-dsm-5m`)
  ) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Elevation", colors = terrain.colors(10)) +
  coord_equal()
```

## Raster math and Canopy Height Models

We can perform raster calculations by subtracting (or adding, multiplying, etc.) two rasters. In the geospatial world, we call this “raster math”.

Let’s subtract the DTM from the DSM to create a Canopy Height Model. After subtracting, let’s create a data frame so we can plot with `ggplot`.


```{r chm}
CHM_TUD <- DSM_TUD - DTM_TUD
CHM_TUD_df <- as.data.frame(CHM_TUD, xy = TRUE)
```

We can now plot the output CHM.
```{r plot-chm}
ggplot() +
  geom_raster(
    data = CHM_TUD_df,
    aes(x = x, y = y, fill = `tud-dsm-5m`)
  ) +
  scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Canopy Height", colors = terrain.colors(10)) +
  coord_equal()
```

Let’s have a look at the distribution of values in our newly created Canopy Height Model (CHM).
```{r chm-hist}
ggplot(CHM_TUD_df) +
  geom_histogram(aes(`tud-dsm-5m`))
```
Notice that the range of values for the output CHM starts right below 0 and ranges to almost 100 meters. Does this make sense for buildings and trees in Delft?

::: challenge

### Challenge: Explore CHM Raster Values

It is often a good idea to explore the range of values in a raster dataset just like we might explore a dataset that we collected in the field.

1. What is the minimum and maximum value for the Canopy Height Model `CHM_TUD` that we just created?
2. What is the distribution of all the pixel values in the CHM?
3. Plot the `CHM_TUD` raster using breaks that make sense for the data.

::: solution

```{r chm-challenge}
min(CHM_TUD_df$`tud-dsm-5m`, na.rm = TRUE)
max(CHM_TUD_df$`tud-dsm-5m`, na.rm = TRUE)

ggplot(CHM_TUD_df) +
  geom_histogram(aes(`tud-dsm-5m`))

custom_bins <- c(-5, 0, 10, 20, 30, 100)
CHM_TUD_df <- CHM_TUD_df |>
  mutate(canopy_discrete = cut(`tud-dsm-5m`, breaks = custom_bins))

ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = CHM_TUD_df, aes(
    x = x,
    y = y,
    fill = canopy_discrete
  )) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = terrain.colors(5)) +
  coord_quickmap()
```

### Two Ways to Perform Raster Calculations

We can calculate the difference between two rasters in two different ways:

- by directly subtracting the two rasters in R using raster math, as we did above,

or for more efficient processing, particularly if our rasters are large and/or the calculations we are performing are complex:

- using the `lapp()` function.

See how `lapp()` is used in [this lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/r-raster-vector-geospatial/instructor/04-raster-calculations-in-r.html#efficient-raster-calculations).

:::

## Export a GeoTIFF

Now that we have created a new raster, let’s export the data as a GeoTIFF file using the `writeRaster()` function. A GeoTIFF is a metadata standard that has the georeferencing information embedded within the image.

When we write this raster object to a GeoTIFF file we name it `CHM_TUD.tiff`. This name allows us to quickly remember both what the data contains (CHM data) and for where (TU Delft campus and surroundings). The `writeRaster()` function by default writes the output file to your working directory unless you specify a full file path.

We will specify the output format `"GTiff"` and tell R to overwrite any data that is already in a file of the same name.
```{r chm-write}
writeRaster(CHM_TUD, "fig/CHM_TUD.tiff",
  filetype = "GTiff",
  overwrite = TRUE
)
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Rasters can be computed on using mathematical functions.
- The `writeRaster()` function can be used to write raster data to a file.
