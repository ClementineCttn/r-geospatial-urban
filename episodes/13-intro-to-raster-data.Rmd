::: prereq

# Things you'll need to complete this episode

See the [setup instructions](../learners/setup.md) for detailed information about the software, data, and other prerequisites you will need to work through the examples in this episode.

This lesson uses the `terra` package in particular. If you have not installed it yet, do so by running `install.packages("terra")` before attaching it with `library(terra)`.

:::

In this lesson, we will work with raster data. We will start with an introduction of the fundamental principles and metadata needed to work with raster data in R. We will discuss some of the core metadata elements needed to understand raster data in R, including CRS and resolution. 

We continue to work with the `tidyverse` package and we will use the `terra` package to work with raster data. Make sure that you have those packages loaded.

```{r load-pkgs, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(terra)

# The data used in this lesson

In this and lesson, we will use:

- data extracted from the [AHN digital elevation dataset of the Netherlands](https://www.ahn.nl/) for the TU Delft campus area; and
- high-resolution RGB aerial photos of the TU Delft library obtained from [Beeldmateriaal Nederland](https://www.beeldmateriaal.nl/download-luchtfotos).

## View Raster File Attributes

We will be working with a series of GeoTIFF files in this lesson. The GeoTIFF format contains a set of embedded tags with metadata about the raster data. We can use the function `describe()` from the `terra` package to get information about our raster. It is recommended to do this before importing the data. We first examine the file `tud-dsm-5m.tif`.

```{r attr}
describe("data/tud-dsm-5m.tif")
```
We will be using this information throughout this episode. By the end of the episode, you will be able to explain and understand the output above.

## Open a Raster in R

Now that we've previewed the metadata for our GeoTIFF, let's import this raster file into R and explore its metadata more closely. We can use the `rast()` function to import a raster file in R.

::: callout
# Data tip - Object names  
To improve code readability, use file and object names that make it clear what is in the file. The raster data for this episode contain the TU Delft campus and its surroundings so we will use the naming convention `<DATATYPE>_TUD`. The first object is a Digital Surface Model (DSM) in GeoTIFF format stored in a file `tud-dsm-5m.tif` which we will load into an object named according to our naming convention `DSM_TUD`.
:::

Let's load our raster file into R and view its data structure.

```{r read-dsm}
DSM_TUD <- rast("data/tud-dsm-5m.tif")
DSM_TUD
```
The information above includes a report on dimension, resolution, extent and CRS, but no information about the values. Similar to other data structures in R like vectors and data frames, descriptive statistics for raster data can be retrieved with the `summary()` function.

```{r dsm-summary, warning=TRUE}
summary(DSM_TUD)
```

This output gives us information about the range of values in the DSM. We can see, for instance, that the lowest elevation is `-5.2235`, the highest is `89.7838`. But note the warning. Unless you force R to calculate these statistics using every cell in the raster, it will take a random sample of 100,000 cells and calculate from them instead. To force calculation all the values, you can use the function `values`:

```{r dsm-summary2}
summary(values(DSM_TUD))
```

With a summary on all cells of the raster, the values range from a smaller minimum of `-5.3907` to a higher maximum of `92.0910`.

To visualise the DSM in R using `ggplot2`, we need to convert it to a data frame. We learned about data frames in an [earlier lesson](../episodes/03-explore-data.Rmd). The `terra` package has the built-in method `as.data.frame()` for conversion to a data frame.

```{r dsm-df}
DSM_TUD_df <- as.data.frame(DSM_TUD, xy = TRUE)
```

Now when we view the structure of our data, we will see a standard data frame format in which every row is a cell from the raster, each containing information about the `x` and `y` coordinates and the raster value stored in the `tud-dsm-5m` column.

```{r dsm-df-str}
str(DSM_TUD_df)
```

We can use `ggplot()` to plot this data with a specific `geom_` function called `geom_raster()`. We will make the colour scale in our plot colour-blindness friendly with `scale_fill_viridis_c`, introduced in an [earlier lesson](../episodes/04-intro-to-visualisation.Rmd). We will also use the `coord_equal()` function to ensure that the units (meters in our case) on the two axes are equal.

```{r first-rast-plot, fig.cap="Raster plot with `ggplot2` using the viridis color scale"}
ggplot() +
    geom_raster(data = DSM_TUD_df , aes(x = x, y = y, fill = `tud-dsm-5m`)) +
    scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "turbo") +
    coord_equal() 
```

::: callout
# Plotting tip

The `"turbo"` scale in our code provides a good contrasting scale for our raster, but another colour scale may be preferred when plotting other rasters. More information about the viridis palette used above can be found in the [viridis package documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html).
:::

::: callout
# Plotting tip

For faster previews, you can use the `plot()` function on a `terra` object.

```{r dsm-plot}
plot(DSM_TUD)
```

## View Raster Coordinate Reference System (CRS)

The map above shows our Digital Surface Model (DSM), that is, the elevation of our study site including buildings and vegetation. From the legend we can confirm that the maximum elevation is around 90, but we cannot tell whether that is 90 feet or 90 meters because the legend does not show us the units. We can look at the metadata of our object to see what the units are. Much of the metadata that we are interested in is part of the CRS.

Now we will see how features of the CRS appear in our data file and what meaning they have.

We can view the CRS string associated with our R object using the `crs()` function.

```{r dsm-crs}
crs(DSM_TUD, proj = TRUE)
```

::: challenge

# Challenge: What units are our data in?

::: solution

`+units=m` in the output of the code above tells us that our data is in meters (m).

# Understanding CRS in PROJ.4 format

The CRS for our data is given to us by R in PROJ.4 format. Let’s break down the pieces of a PROJ.4 string. The string contains all of the individual CRS elements that R or another GIS might need. Each element is specified with a `+` sign, similar to how a `.csv` file is delimited or broken up by a `,`. After each `+` we see the CRS element such as projection (`proj=`) being defined.

See more about CRS and PROJ.4 strings in [this lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/03-crs#describing-coordinate-reference-systems).

## Calculate Raster Min and Max values

It is useful to know the minimum and maximum values of a raster dataset. In this case, as we are working with elevation data, these values represent the minimum-to-maximum elevation range at our site.

Raster statistics are often calculated and embedded in a GeoTIFF for us. We can view these values:
```{r dsm-minmax}
minmax(DSM_TUD)
```

::: callout
# Data tip - Set min and max values

If the `min` and `max` values are `Inf` and `-Inf` respectively, it means that they haven't been calculated. We can calculate them using the `setMinMax()` function.

```{r dsm-setminmax}
DSM_TUD <- setMinMax(DSM_TUD)
```
:::

A call to `minmax(DSM_TUD)` will now give us the correct values. Alternatively, `min(values())` and `max(values())` will return the minimum and maximum values respectively.

```{r dsm-min}
min(values(DSM_TUD))
```

```{r dsm-max}
max(values(DSM_TUD))
```

We can see that the elevation at our site ranges from `-5.39069`m to `92.08102`m.

## Raster bands

The Digital Surface Model object (`DSM_TUD`) that we have been working with is a single band raster. This means that there is only one layer stored in the raster: surface elevation in meters for one time period. 

We can view the number of bands in a raster using the `nlyr()` function.

```{r dsm-nlyr}
nlyr(DSM_TUD)
```

![Single- and multi-band raster](https://datacarpentry.org/r-raster-vector-geospatial/fig/dc-spatial-raster/single_multi_raster.png)

Our DSM data has only one band. However, raster data can also be multi-band, meaning that one raster file contains data for more than one variable or time period for each cell. We will discuss multi-band raster data in a [later episode](../episodes/17-work-with-multi-band-rasters.Rmd).

## Creating a histogram of raster values

A histogram can be used to inspect the distribution of raster values visually. It can show if there are values above the maximum or below the minimum of the expected range. We can plot a histogram using the `ggplot2` function `geom_histogram()`. Histograms are often useful in identifying outliers and bad data values in our raster data. Read more on the use of histograms in [this lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/r-raster-vector-geospatial/01-raster-structure.html#create-a-histogram-of-raster-values)

::: challenge

# Challenge: Explore raster metadata

Use `describe()` to determine the following about the `tud-dsm-hill.tif` file:

1. Does this file have the same CRS as `DSM_TUD`?
2. What is the resolution of the raster data?
3. How large would a 5x5 pixel area be on the Earth’s surface?
4. Is the file a multi- or single-band raster?

Note that this file is a hillshade raster. We will learn about hillshades in the [Working with Multi-band Rasters in R](../episodes/17-work-with-multi-band-rasters.Rmd) episode.

::: solution

```{r dsm-describe}
describe("data/tud-dsm-5m-hill.tif")
```
